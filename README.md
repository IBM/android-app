# Create an Android application

> We have applications available for [Node.js Express](https://github.com/IBM/node-express-app), [Go Gin](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app), [Python Django](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-app), [Swift Kitura](https://github.com/IBM/swift-kitura-app), and [Android](https://github.com/IBM/android-app).

In this sample, you will create an Android application complete with standard best practices. An Android app is a software application running on the Android platform. Because the Android platform is built for mobile devices, a typical Android app is designed for a smartphone or a tablet PC running on the Android OS.

## Steps

You can manage CI/CD [for this application in IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?navMode=starterkits) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

    <img src="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button_x2.png" alt="Deploy to IBM Cloud">
    </a>
</p>

Use the button above to develop this same application on IBM Cloud. This option will create a CI/CD pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and DevOps toolchain. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can run the application natively.

#### Native Application Development

- Install the latest [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) 3.5.3+ version.

To run your application locally:

- Clone the repo locally, and import the project into Android Studio

- Follow the instructions here to run the Android application on an emulator: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app


Your application will be running within your chosen device emulator.
